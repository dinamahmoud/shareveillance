##Shareveillance

###Shareveillance addresses the Studio-X-to-Web relationship, focusing on the representation of self in the digital realm and the uneasy tension between curation, exposure, automation, and control.    

###This program connects the ‘real world’ Studio-X with a new web presence based on a seamless collage of real-time video feeds of key focal points activated by a small-scale “Internet of Things.”

###It exploits the web’s ability to create new adjacencies by collapsing space and time while harnessing the use of cameras, printers, and sensor technology to playfully ground the digital in the ephemeral, sensual spatial realm.

###In this way, Shareveillance blurs the line between ‘real world’ and ‘web world’ content and confuses the normative offline-online data flows and representations. By stitching together disparate views into an ‘impossible’ collage space and activating its contents through unfamiliar digital/analog interactions, Shareveillance constructs a  new reality that is simultaneously flattened and spatial, automated and haptic. 


###It activates the standard "bio" webpage by linking tagged Studio-X residents and their personal effects to their online representations.

###Tagging Studio-X residents is the first step towards creating an experimental Studio-X scale "Internet of Things." Using an active RFID tracking system, people can be followed in real-time, allowing for their presence or absence and location on-site to be communicated directly to the web. Additionally, residents can choose personal items to be tagged and embedded with biographical information—much like typical online ‘avatars’ or profile pages. When residents check in for the day, they store their tagged items in the Xavatar area for web users to click, scan, and explore. The Xavatar bio page can reflect the quotidian—a bowl of keys or a coat rack—or be specialized and strange—a pile of books or a set of bobble heads . Studio-X residents can easily add, take away, and change what is represented on the bio page by simply placing and removing physical items and RFID tags or QR codes in the Xavatar space, maintaining the connection with the sensory world and bypassing the need to type out code and translate experience.
