##Shareveillance

###Shareveillance addresses the Studio-X-to-Web relationship, focusing on the representation of self in the digital realm and the uneasy tension between curation, exposure, automation, and control.    

###This program connects the ‘real world’ Studio-X with a new web presence based on a seamless collage of real-time video feeds of key focal points activated by a small-scale “Internet of Things.”

###It exploits the web’s ability to create new adjacencies by collapsing space and time while harnessing the use of cameras, printers, and sensor technology to playfully ground the digital in the ephemeral, sensual spatial realm.

###Shareveillance activates the standard "bio" webpage by linking tagged Studio-X residents and their personal effects to their online content.

###In this way, it blurs the line between ‘real world’ and ‘web world’ content and confuses the normative offline-online data flows and representations. By stitching together disparate views into an ‘impossible’ collage space and activating its contents through unfamiliar digital/analog interactions, Shareveillance constructs a  new reality that is simultaneously flattened and spatial, automated and haptic.

###Shareveillance also has the capability to take full advantage of the Internet of things. Studio-X could activate any person or object using active RFID tracking and QR code recognition, grafting the social media presence of anyone in the space onto the Studio-X website. A bowl of keys or a coat rack can act as a bio page for the whole Studio, or a wall decal can become the about page. Studio-X residents can easily add, take away, and change what is represented by moving artifacts or their own bodies in physical space.
