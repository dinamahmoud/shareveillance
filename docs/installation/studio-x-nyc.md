The Raspberry Pi has an HDMI output port, so it's quite easy to connect it to a projector. You'll want to look into video codecs and other Linux-based solutions for dealing with video and image content. For instance, check out http://www.ffmpeg.org/ and the Raspberry Pi camera. Do some Google sleuthing on streaming video with a Raspberry Pi: for instance, http://blog.tkjelectronics.dk/2013/06/how-to-stream-video-and-audio-from-a-raspberry-pi-with-no-latency/.

The Raspberry Pi camera has a number of built-in filters that you'll want to Google, as you'll likely be using it (it's HD, small and cheap - $25 - and I bought a few for the class already). You should also search around Github for anything to do with video streaming and image processing. If you're into computer vision, like facial recognition, check out https://github.com/peterbraden/node-opencv. If you're into making animated GIFs, or superimposing images, or other Photoshop-like features, check out https://github.com/rsms/node-imagemagick.

You'll also need to have a stance on what kind of content you're projecting and why. The notion of personal space and sharing came up in the discussion, so we will want to know if this is what you're taking on, or if you're going another way. If you are working with cameras and projectors, you MUST have a stance on surveillance. In the Glenn Greenwald/Eric Snowden micro-era we are in, this cannot be ignored, and it is too good of an opportunity to spark a debate to go unheeded.
